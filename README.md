Little web chat that can help you talk to a really stupid oponent

The HTML code creates a list of messages, each with a user photo, signature, and message. The JavaScript code fetches the list of messages from a server and then adds them to the DOM. It also creates a new message object when the user clicks the send button and sends it to the server.

The CSS code styles the chat application.

Completely lost in JavaScript code, need to have a strong feedback.

Thank you.
